# Artistic Neural Style Transfer
Artistic neural style transfer with magenta.js

Artistic neural style transfer is an optimization technique used to take two images—a content image and a style reference image (such as an artwork by a famous painter)—and blend them together so the output image looks like the content image, but "painted" in the style of the style reference image.
